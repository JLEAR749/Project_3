AS A USER, I want to be able to start a virtual app to participate in trivia
I WANT TO save top scores and 
SO THAT I can show off my knowledge

### Installation

When a user opens the app they are presented with a signup/ login form.    If the user has already created an account they can use the login and access their profile and their movie review/ rating dashboard. If the user doesn't have an account they can create one by entering a Username, Email, and Password.

Once logged in the user will have the ability to start the trivia.  Here is your time to show off your knowledge.
